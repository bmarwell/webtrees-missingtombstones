### Introduction

This module for webtrees (currently 1.6.x only) will create a list of persons, deceased in the past 30 years,
who do not have a media type = tombstone attached. This is useful, if you need to add data which can be found
on tombstones, gravestones, headstones (like birth year, year of death, maiden name). Headstones are also a historical and 
[cultural property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_property), which should be preserved.


### Installation
1. Copy the folder src/missingtombstones (only the subfolder) to your webtrees/modules_v3-folder.
2. Go to the admin menu and modules, then enable the Missing Tombstones-Module.

### Verification
To see if it works, open this link: 
    module.php?mod=missingtombstones&mod_action=general

There is no menu link yet, and no parameter for the number of years.

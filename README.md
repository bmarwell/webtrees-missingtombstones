## Introduction

This module for webtrees 1.7.x  will create a list of persons, deceased in the past 30 years,
who do not have any media of `type = tombstone` attached. This is useful, if you need to add data which can be found
on tombstones, gravestones, headstones (like birth year, year of death, maiden name). Headstones are also a historical and 
[cultural property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_property), which should be preserved.


### Installation
1. Extract the `.tar.bz2` file to your `webtrees/modules_v3`-folder.
2. Go to the admin menu and modules, then enable the Missing Tombstones-Module.

### Verification
To see if it works, open this link: 
    `module.php?mod=missingtombstones&mod_action=general`

There should also be a menu link in the reports menu.

## Usage
From the reports menu, select the link that says "Missing Tombstones". 
You should get a menu which looks like this:

![Missing Tombstones Individual List](/assets/missinglist-de.png)

### Configuration

At the moment you can configure how many years the page should show.
For this, go to the _control panel_, select _Module Administration_ and 
click on the **missing tombstones** entry. You should now see a configuration
page, where you can select the desired amount of years.

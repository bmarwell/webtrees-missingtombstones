### Introduction

This module for webtrees 1.7.x  will create a list of persons, deceased in the past 30 years,
who do not have any media of `type = tombstone` attached. This is useful, if you need to add data which can be found
on tombstones, gravestones, headstones (like birth year, year of death, maiden name). Headstones are also a historical and 
[cultural property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_property), which should be preserved.


### Installation
1. Extract the `.tar.bz2` file to your `webtrees/modules_v3`-folder.
2. Go to the admin menu and modules, then enable the Missing Tombstones-Module.

### Verification
To see if it works, open this link: 
    `module.php?mod=missingtombstones&mod_action=general`

There should also be a menu link in the reports menu.

### Translation
If you'd like to commit translation files, please send me your `.po` files using a pull request.
You can generate a `messages.pot`-file using `make update` from the command line.
